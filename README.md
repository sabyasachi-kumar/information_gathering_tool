# Information Gathering Tool
This is a Python script designed to retrieve valuable information from a given URL. The 
script utilizes various Python libraries, including requests for HTTP requests, socket for IP address 
resolution, and json for parsing JSON data. Its primary purpose is to provide users with insights into a 
specified website, such as its HTTP headers, IP address, geolocation, and region information.
The script extracts the domain name from the URL, resolves it to an IP address, and then queries the 
'ipinfo.io' API to retrieve geolocation details, including the latitude and longitude coordinates and the 
region where the IP address is located. The resulting information is presented to the user in a structured 
format, making it a useful tool for gaining insights into web properties. This script can be applied in 
various scenarios, such as network troubleshooting, web analytics, and website monitoring. Overall, this 
Python script provides a convenient and efficient way to gather essential information about a website, 
aiding users in understanding its technical and geographical aspects. Feel free to adapt this abstract as 
needed for your specific submission or presentation.
